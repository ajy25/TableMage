### Q&A:

1. 
    Q: Why not just use scikit-learn for machine learning? 

    A: scikit-learn is *the* Python machine learning modeling package; TabularMagic and many other solutions rely heavily on scikit-learn. Though sklearn pipelines allows for streamlined data preprocessing and ML modeling, they are by no means low-code and require a nontrivial amount of documentation reading, programming experience, and machine learning knowledge to use. 


2. 
    Q: Are there other open source projects similar to TabularMagic?

    A: Yes. PyCaret, AutoGluon, and EvalML all speed up machine learning experimentation. PyCaret in particular is great for machine learning model benchmarking and includes support for time series data. We recommend checking it out!
